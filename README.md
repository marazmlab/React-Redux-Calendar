## ðŸ”¶ Tasks Overview

The project contains several tasks organized in folders `01` to `05`, each demonstrating different styling methods. Below is an overview of the tasks:

- Meeting List: Displays a list of scheduled meetings fetched from the JSON server.
- Add Meeting: Allows users to schedule new meetings using a form.
- Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark themes dynamically.
- Redux Integration: Centralized state management for meetings using Redux.

## ðŸ”¶ Solutions provided in the project

### Example: Adding a Meeting

```jsx
<Card>
  <Card.Img src="image.jpg" alt="Example" />
  <Card.Body>
    <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>Some example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</Card.Text>
    <Button variant="primary">Go somewhere</Button>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```
This example showcases:
- **Form validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled and email is valid.
- **API integration**: Sends the form data to the JSON server and updates the Redux store.


&nbsp;

## ðŸ”¶ Conclusions

- **State management**: Redux simplifies state handling and makes the application scalable.
- **Component structure**: The project demonstrates modular and reusable components.
- **Styling**: SCSS modules are used for consistent and maintainable styles. 
- **API integration**: The project fetches and persists data using a local JSON server.

This project provides a solid foundation for mastering React and Redux.
