## ðŸ”¶ Code Examples

### Redux Store Configuration

```javascript
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import currencyReducer from './reducers/currencyReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    currency: currencyReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```

### API Integration Service

```javascript
const fetchExchangeRate = async (targetCurrency = null, date = 'latest') => {
    const API_KEY = 'd4fc05d2e0918ea984d9e900ba8f6147';
    const url = `https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/${date}?access_key=${API_KEY}`;

    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        
        if (!data.success) {
            throw new Error(data.error.type || "Unknown API error");
        }

        return data.rates;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching exchange rate:", error);
        return null;
    }
};
